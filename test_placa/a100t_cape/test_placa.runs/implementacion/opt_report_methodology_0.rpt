There is a large setup violation of -2.771 ns between teclas/sdramtests_reg/C (clocked by clk_out3_clk_wiz_0) and test_sdram/addr_to_test_reg[4]/R (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#87 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -2.771 ns between teclas/sdramtests_reg/C (clocked by clk_out3_clk_wiz_0) and test_sdram/addr_to_test_reg[5]/R (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
