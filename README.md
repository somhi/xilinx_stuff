# Xilinx stuff

Includes various projects I'm working on while learning how to work with Xilinx FPGAs

* FPGA I have is **QMTECH_XC7A100T** (xc7a100tfgg676-1)

I have different carrier boards for this FPGAs, so there could be different projects depending on the carrier board used:

* QMTECH_DB_For_FPGA_V04   (official QMTECH addon)
* DECA retro cape addon + mister sdram module + Pmod SD card + Pmod Audio + duponts
* Neptuno carrier board
